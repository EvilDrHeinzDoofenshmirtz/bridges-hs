  "aquarium" : `
    Aquarium Learn about arrays of objects by creating an aquarium. Arrays in Java are data structures that hold multiple objects in one memory location. They can hold a fixed number of one type of object or variable, but that object can be almost anything. In this project, we will practice manipulating arrays and accessing elements using methods from the Array class. You are the owner of an aquarium with a fixed number of tanks, you also happen to be a little indecisive and like to change which fish go in what tanks. Think of the aquarium as an array, each tank represents an index, and the fish are the objects.

    BugStomp Make a whack-a-mole style game where the player stomps bugs to increase their score. BugStomp is a whack-a-mole style game where you use the arrow keys to move your player and attempt to touch or "stomp" the bug. The bug flashes to a random location on the board after a set number of frames. For each bug stomped, the score increases until the player eventually wins. In this project, you will implement the BugStomp game with BRIDGES.
